		\section{ 1. Introduction}
		\hspace{1cm}In the landscape of higher education, ensuring that academic programs meet their intended educational objectives and accreditation standards is paramount. This involves a meticulous process of aligning Course Outcomes (COs) with Program Outcomes (POs) to ensure that the curriculum delivers the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies that students are expected to acquire. This alignment, known as CO-PO mapping, serves as a cornerstone for educational quality assurance, providing a structured framework for assessing and enhancing the effectiveness of academic programs.
		The CO-PO mapping process typically involves defining specific outcomes for each course, which are then correlated with broader program outcomes. Course Outcomes are specific, measurable statements that describe what students are expected to learn and achieve by the end of a course. Program Outcomes, on the other hand, are broader statements that describe the knowledge, skills, and abilities that graduates of a program should possess. Effective CO-PO mapping ensures that each course contributes to the overall program goals, thereby supporting a cohesive and integrated educational experience for students.
		\\ \vspace{1ex} 
		Despite its critical importance, the traditional approach to CO-PO mapping is fraught with challenges. Educators often rely on manual methods, such as spreadsheets and paper-based documentation, to create and analyze CO-PO mapping tables. These methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and inconsistencies. The manual nature of the process requires educators to spend significant time on data entry, calculations, and revisions, which detracts from their core teaching responsibilities. Furthermore, the lack of standardization in CO-PO mapping practices across different courses and programs can lead to varied interpretations and implementations, undermining the reliability of assessment results.
		The complexity of CO-PO mapping is further compounded by the need for continuous updates and revisions. As educational programs evolve and curricula are revised, CO-PO mappings must be regularly updated to reflect these changes. This dynamic nature of educational programs necessitates a flexible and efficient system for managing CO-PO mappings. The current manual approach is ill-equipped to handle the scalability and adaptability required for effective CO-PO management, leading to outdated or inaccurate mappings that compromise the quality of assessments.
		\clearpage
		
		
		\hspace{1cm}In response to these challenges, there is a growing need for an automated, web-based solution that can streamline the CO-PO mapping process. Such a system would significantly reduce the time and effort required for creating, analyzing, and updating CO-PO mappings, thereby allowing educators to focus more on instructional activities and student engagement. An automated system would also enhance the accuracy and consistency of CO-PO mappings by providing standardized templates and automated calculations. This would ensure that all courses and programs adhere to a uniform standard, facilitating more reliable and meaningful assessments.
		The CO-PO Attainment System aims to address these needs by offering a comprehensive, user-friendly platform for managing CO-PO mappings. Developed using cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, this system provides educators with intuitive tools for creating, editing, and analyzing CO-PO mappings. Next.js, a powerful React framework, enables the creation of a responsive and dynamic user interface that enhances user experience. TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, adds static types to the code, improving code quality and maintainability. Node.js, a versatile runtime environment, allows for the development of scalable server-side applications, while MongoDB, a NoSQL database, ensures efficient storage and retrieval of CO-PO data.
		
		
		A key feature of the CO-PO Attainment System is its robust data storage capabilities. Leveraging MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility, the system ensures that all CO-PO mapping data is securely stored and easily accessible. This facilitates efficient data management and retrieval, allowing educators to quickly access and update CO-PO mappings as needed. Additionally, the system incorporates advanced authentication and security measures through Clerk, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify sensitive data. Clerk provides a comprehensive authentication solution that includes user registration, login, and role-based access control, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the system.
		The development of the CO-PO Attainment System represents a significant step forward in the quest for more effective and efficient educational assessment practices. By automating the CO-PO mapping process, the system not only alleviates the administrative burden on educators but also enhances the overall quality and reliability of assessments.
		
		This, in turn, supports continuous improvement in educational programs, helping institutions to achieve and maintain high standards of educational excellence. The automated calculation module embedded within the system simplifies the process of deriving mapping levels and assessing CO-PO attainment, allowing educators to generate accurate and comprehensive reports with minimal effort.Furthermore, the CO-PO Attainment System is designed with scalability and adaptability in mind. As educational programs continue to evolve, the system can be easily expanded and customized to accommodate new requirements and changes in curriculum. This ensures that the system remains relevant and useful in the long term, providing a sustainable solution for CO-PO mapping and assessment. The system's export functionality, which enables users to generate detailed reports in Excel format, facilitates data sharing and further analysis, enhancing the overall utility of the platform.
		
		The adoption of the CO-PO Attainment System is expected to yield numerous benefits for educational institutions. By providing a centralized platform for managing CO-PO data, the system streamlines workflows and ensures consistent application of standards across courses and programs. This not only improves the accuracy and reliability of assessments but also enhances transparency and accountability in the educational process.

		\subsection{3.4 Data Flow Diagram}
		\hspace{1cm}The provided diagram is a Level 0 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) that offers a high-level overview of the CO PO Mapping System, designed for educational purposes to map Course Outcomes (CO) to Program Outcomes (PO). The diagram includes three main components: the Teacher, the CO PO Mapping System, and the Database.
		The Teacher is the external entity that interacts with the CO PO Mapping System. The primary interaction starts with the teacher inputting CO-PO data into the system. Once the data is inputted, the CO PO Mapping System processes this information. It performs the necessary calculations to map the course outcomes to the program outcomes. After processing, the system generates the results and creates corresponding tables.
		These results and tables are then stored in the Database for future reference and use. The database serves as a repository for all CO-PO data and the results of calculations performed by the system. The CO PO Mapping System can retrieve stored CO-PO data from the database as needed to provide updated information or to perform additional calculations.
		Finally, the processed data, along with any generated tables, is sent back to the teacher. This allows the teacher to access and review the CO-PO calculations and tables generated by the system. Overall, the diagram illustrates the flow of data and the interactions between the teacher, the CO PO Mapping System, and the database, highlighting the process of inputting, processing, storing, and retrieving CO-PO data.

		\hspace{1cm}The provided diagram is a detailed depiction of the CO PO Mapping System, illustrating the interactions between the teacher, the system, and the database. The teacher is the primary user who manages CO-PO data through the system. The system itself comprises four main functions: creating, editing, deleting, and viewing CO-PO mappings.
		When the teacher wants to create a CO-PO mapping, they input new CO-PO data into the system. This data is then sent to the database, where the new mapping is stored. For editing a CO-PO mapping, the teacher retrieves the existing mapping from the database through the system. After making the necessary changes, the updated mapping is saved back into the database.
		If the teacher needs to delete a CO-PO mapping, they select the unwanted mapping within the system. The system processes this request and updates the database by removing the specified mapping. Lastly, to view a CO-PO mapping, the teacher uses the system to retrieve and display the existing mappings from the database.
		The database serves as the central repository, storing all the CO-PO mappings. It interacts with the system to store new mappings, update existing ones, delete unwanted mappings, and provide data for viewing. The system ensures that all data manipulations—creating, editing, deleting, and viewing—are accurately reflected in the database, maintaining data integrity and accessibility for the teacher.
